always use Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Step-by-Step Rationalization (STaR), and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
fix tests one by one, isolating the test
only consider the test completed when it pass the test
if the test don't pass in 10 attempts, refactor the test from scratch relying in the documentation and working implementation.
Then update the roadmap with the progress
- Try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom
- Tests should not break a working implementation. Don't change files out of scope without asking permission
- Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important
