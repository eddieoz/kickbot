**BDD Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 17.1: Standard Follow Event with Nested User Object
```gherkin
Given a follow webhook event is received
And the payload contains: {"follower": {"username": "testuser123"}}
When the follow event handler processes the data
Then the follower_name should be "testuser123"
And the alert should display "Novo seguidor: testuser123!"
```

#### Scenario 17.2: Follow Event with Alternative Payload Structure
```gherkin
Given a follow webhook event is received  
And the payload contains: {"user": {"username": "testuser456"}}
When the follow event handler processes the data
Then the follower_name should be "testuser456"
And the alert should display "Novo seguidor: testuser456!"
```

#### Scenario 17.3: Follow Event with Missing Username Falls Back
```gherkin
Given a follow webhook event is received
And the payload contains: {"follower": {}}
When the follow event handler processes the data
Then the follower_name should be "Unknown"
And the alert should display "Novo seguidor: Unknown!"
```

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Write tests for multiple payload structures
2. Implement robust username extraction for follow events
3. Add fallback strategies for various payload formats
4. Verify alert display functionality

- Created robust `extract_tier_from_payload()` function with multiple extraction strategies
- Supports standard `{"subscriber": {"username": ...}, "tier": ...}`, alternative `{"user": {"username": ...}, "subscription_tier": ...}`, and various tier field formats
- Updated `handle_subscription_event()` to use new extraction logic
- All BDD scenarios pass: 8/8 tests âœ…
- Integration tests validate complete functionality: 5/5 tests âœ…
- Performance verified: <0.1s for complex payloads
- Tier extraction supports: `tier`, `subscription_tier`, `level`, `subscription.tier`, `sub_tier` fields

### Technical Analysis:
Current code in `oauth_webhook_server.py:420`:
```python
subscriber_name = event_data.get('subscriber', {}).get('username', 'Unknown')
```

**BDD Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 18.1: Standard Subscription Event with Nested User Object
```gherkin
Given a subscription webhook event is received
And the payload contains: {"subscriber": {"username": "testuser789"}, "tier": 2}
When the subscription event handler processes the data
Then the subscriber_name should be "testuser789"
And the tier should be 2
And the alert should display "Nova assinatura Tier 2: testuser789!"
```

#### Scenario 18.2: Subscription Event with Alternative Payload Structure
```gherkin
Given a subscription webhook event is received
And the payload contains: {"user": {"username": "testuser999"}, "subscription_tier": 1}
When the subscription event handler processes the data
Then the subscriber_name should be "testuser999"
And the tier should be 1
And the alert should display "Nova assinatura Tier 1: testuser999!"
```

#### Scenario 18.3: Subscription Event with Direct Username Field
```gherkin
Given a subscription webhook event is received
And the payload contains: {"username": "directuser", "tier": 3}
When the subscription event handler processes the data
Then the subscriber_name should be "directuser"
And the tier should be 3
And the alert should display "Nova assinatura Tier 3: directuser!"
```

## Story 19: Fix Gift Subscription Points Integration (1 point)

**As a** streamer  
**I want** gift subscription events to award points to gifters  
**So that** my points system works correctly with the webhook integration

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Gift subscription events properly call `_handle_gifted_subscriptions` 
- [x] Points are awarded to the correct gifter username
- [x] `!subgift_add` chat command is executed with correct parameters
- [x] Points calculation follows existing formula (amount * GiftBlokitos setting)
- [x] Integration works for both direct and correlated gift events

### âœ… STORY 19 COMPLETED
**Implementation Results:**
- **Root Cause Identified**: The `_handle_gifted_subscriptions` method was using legacy `send_message_in_chat` function requiring XSRF tokens, incompatible with OAuth webhook authentication
- **Solution Implemented**: Created `_send_chat_message_oauth_compatible()` method with cascading authentication strategies:
  1. **OAuth Method**: Uses `send_message_in_chat_async` for bots with `auth_manager`
  2. **HTTP Session Method**: Uses `send_message_in_chat_async` for bots with `http_session`  
  3. **Legacy Fallback**: Uses `send_message_in_chat` for traditional bots with XSRF tokens
- **Webhook Integration Fixed**: Gift subscription webhooks now properly execute `!subgift_add` chat commands
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy bots continue to work without changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback and comprehensive logging for all authentication scenarios
- **All BDD scenarios pass**: 10/10 tests âœ…
- **OAuth integration tests pass**: 9/9 tests âœ… 
- **Authentication issue tests demonstrate fix**: 4/4 tests âœ…

### Technical Analysis:
Current issue: The webhook handlers call `_handle_gifted_subscriptions` but the bot might not be properly receiving the call or the chat command may not be sent.

**BDD Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 19.1: Direct Gift Subscription Points Award
```gherkin
Given a gift subscription webhook event is received
And the gifter is identified as "testgifter"
And the quantity is 3
And GiftBlokitos setting is 200
When the gift subscription handler processes the event
Then _handle_gifted_subscriptions should be called with ("testgifter", 3)
And a chat message "!subgift_add testgifter 600" should be sent
And points should be awarded to testgifter
```

#### Scenario 19.2: Correlated Gift Subscription Points Award
```gherkin
Given a gift subscription webhook with empty payload is received
And chat correlation identifies gifter as "correlatedgifter"
And the quantity is 5
And GiftBlokitos setting is 150
When the correlation result is processed
Then _handle_gifted_subscriptions should be called with ("correlatedgifter", 5)
And a chat message "!subgift_add correlatedgifter 750" should be sent
And points should be awarded to correlatedgifter
```

#### Scenario 19.3: Gift Subscription with Bot Instance Missing
```gherkin
Given a gift subscription webhook event is received
And the bot_instance is None
When the gift subscription handler processes the event
Then no points should be awarded
And an error should be logged about missing bot instance
And the alert should still be sent correctly
```

#### Scenario 19.4: Gift Subscription with Unknown Gifter
```gherkin
Given a gift subscription webhook event is received
And the gifter is identified as "Unknown"
When the gift subscription handler processes the event
Then _handle_gifted_subscriptions should NOT be called
And no chat message should be sent
And the alert should display "Unknown presenteou X assinatura(s)!"
```

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Write comprehensive tests for points integration scenarios
2. Verify bot_instance is properly set and available
3. Test the complete flow from webhook to chat command
4. Add error handling for missing bot instances
5. Validate points calculation logic
6. Test both direct and correlated gift scenarios

### Technical Analysis:
Create a reusable username extraction system that can handle the various payload structures Kick uses.

**BDD Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 20.1: Username Extraction with Multiple Strategies
```gherkin
Given a webhook payload is received
And username extraction strategies are defined for the event type
When extract_username_from_payload is called
Then it should try strategies in order until one succeeds
And return the first successful username found
And log the successful strategy used
```

#### Scenario 20.2: Username Extraction Fallback Handling
```gherkin
Given a webhook payload is received
And all username extraction strategies fail
When extract_username_from_payload is called
Then it should return "Unknown"
And log a warning about extraction failure
And include payload structure in debug logs
```

#### Scenario 20.3: Event Type Specific Extraction
```gherkin
Given different event types are processed
When extract_username_from_payload is called with event_type parameter
Then it should use event-specific extraction strategies
And follow event should check ["follower.username", "user.username", "username"]
And subscription event should check ["subscriber.username", "user.username", "username"]
And gift event should use existing parser logic
```

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Design unified username extraction interface
2. Implement strategy pattern for different payload structures
3. Write comprehensive tests for all strategies
4. Refactor existing event handlers to use utility
5. Add logging and monitoring for extraction success/failure
6. Document supported payload structures
